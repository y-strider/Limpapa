CHAPTER I – DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
1. a. System Overview
1. a. 1. Introduction
The current system for managing the Community Public Library is largely manual. Book borrowing, returns, and inventory tracking are done using paper cards and spreadsheets. This leads to inefficiencies, long queues, difficulty in tracking book availability, and limited access for patrons outside library hours. The Community Public Library Management and Booking System (CPL-MBS) is a proposed web-based application designed to automate these processes. It will provide an online catalog, a digital booking system for books, an automated tracking of loans and returns, and a secure admin panel for librarians.
1. b. Project Site
The system will be deployed for use within the Community Public Library main branch. The primary users (librarians) will access the system via computers located at the help desk. Patrons will access the online catalog and booking features via the internet from their homes or using public terminals within the library.
1. c. Background of the Client
(Since there is no real client, we create one)
The Community Public Library is a fictional, non-profit organization dedicated to providing free access to information and resources for the residents of its city. It has a collection of over 10,000 books and serves an average of 200 patrons daily. The head librarian, Ms. Maria Santos, has expressed the need for a digital solution to reduce administrative workload and improve patron satisfaction. The library operates on a limited annual budget provided by the city government.
1. d. Required Main Module
(This is a high-level list of the system's main features)
1.	User Authentication Module: Handles registration and login for patrons and librarians.
2.	Book Catalog Module: Allows searching, browsing, and viewing book details.
3.	Booking and Loan Management Module: Handles booking, borrowing, return, and renewal of books.
4.	Inventory Management Module: Allows librarians to add, update, or remove books from the catalog.
5.	Reporting Module: Generates reports on popular books, loan history, and overdue items.
6.	Admin Dashboard: Provides an overview of library operations for librarians.
(You would then provide a diagram here, like a module hierarchy chart)
1. d. 1. Description of the Required Main Module
(Here, you would write a short paragraph describing each module from the list above in more detail.)

CHAPTER II – THE COMPANY
(Since you are a student team, "The Company" is your project team. You give your team a name and create a profile.)
2. a. Company Profile
The PentaBox Developers is a student-based software development group formed exclusively for the completion of the Software Engineering 1 course. Composed of five dedicated Information Technology students, the team is committed to applying software engineering principles to deliver a high-quality, functional project.
2. b. Company Logo
(You would create a simple logo for your team. For example, a box with the letters "PB" inside.)
2. c. Company Vision
To become a proficient and respected student team known for developing practical and well-engineered software solutions.
2. d. Company Mission
To successfully design, develop, and deploy the Community Public Library Management and Booking System (CPL-MBS) by applying rigorous software engineering methodologies, effective teamwork, and continuous learning.
2. e. Company Goals
1.	To complete the project within the academic semester timeline.
2.	To deliver a system that meets all specified functional and non-functional requirements.
3.	To gain hands-on experience in all phases of the software development lifecycle.
2. f. Company Policies
2. f. 1. Meetings
Team meetings will be held weekly, every Saturday, via online conference (Google Meet/Zoom). An agenda will be circulated beforehand. Attendance is mandatory.
2. f. 2. Funding
This is an academic project with no monetary funding. All tools used will be free and open-source (e.g., Visual Studio Code, GitHub, MySQL Community Server).
2. f. 3. Penalties
There are no financial penalties. However, consistent failure to meet deadlines or contribute to the project will be documented and may affect the individual's grade as per the course instructor's guidelines.
2. h. Organizational Structure
2. h. 1. Overall Structure
The team follows a flat structure with a Project Manager for coordination. All members are also part of the programming and testing teams.
2. h. 2. Management Team
•	Project Manager: [Student Name]
2. h. 3. System Design Team
•	System Analyst: [Student Name]
•	UI/UX Designer: [Student Name]
2. h. 4. Programming Team
•	All team members.
2. h. 5. Testing Team
•	All team members.
2. h. 6. Training Team
•	[Student Name] (will prepare training materials for the "client" - in this case, the demo for the instructor).
2. h. 7. Documentation Team
•	All team members are responsible for documenting their own work, with [Student Name] consolidating the final manuscript.
(You would create an organizational chart diagram here)
2. i. Company Roles and Responsibilities
(Define the responsibilities for each role you listed in the structure. For example:)
2. i. 1. Project Manager
•	Creates and maintains the project schedule.
•	Facilitates team meetings.
•	Acts as the primary point of contact for the instructor.
•	Ensures the project stays on track.
2. i. 2. System Analyst
•	Leads the requirements gathering and analysis.
•	Creates the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
•	Designs the system models (DFD, ERD).
...(and so on for other roles)

How to Approach the Rest of the Document
For the remaining chapters (III-IX), you will follow the same principle: create fictional but realistic and logical content.
•	CHAPTER III – PROJECT PLAN: Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) by breaking down the project into phases (Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment) and then into smaller tasks.
•	CHAPTER IV – PROJECT SCHEDULES: Assign realistic time estimates (in days) to each task from the WBS and create Gantt charts and network diagrams. An academic project might be planned over a 3-month period.
•	CHAPTER V – PROJECT COSTING: Since there's no budget, you can estimate the cost based on the time invested by the team. Use a hypothetical hourly rate for a student developer (e.g., Php 50/hour) and calculate the "cost" of the man-hours. ROI can be calculated based on the fictional "value" the system brings to the library (e.g., saved hours for librarians).
•	CHAPTER VI – REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING: This is the core. You will define:
o	Stakeholders: Fictional Head Librarian, Librarians, Patrons (Adults, Students).
o	Functional Requirements: "The system shall allow a patron to search for a book by title, author, or ISBN."
o	Non-Functional Requirements: "The system's homepage shall load in under 3 seconds."
•	CHAPTER VII – SYSTEM DESIGN: Create the diagrams (DFD, HIPO, UI Mockups) based on the requirements you defined. You can use tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even PowerPoint.
•	CHAPTER VIII – TESTING PHASE: Write test cases to check if your system would work. For example, "Test Case 1: Login with valid credentials. Expected Result: User is redirected to the dashboard."
•	CHAPTER IX – TRAINING PHASE: Outline a plan for how you would train the librarians (a fictional 2-hour session) and how you would evaluate if they understood the training.
