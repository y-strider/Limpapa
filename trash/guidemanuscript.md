CHAPTER I – DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM

1. a. System Overview
1. a. 1. Introduction

In today’s disruptive financial environment, software solutions are in need to adapt to the consumers’ demand of fast, cost effective access to credit , audit trails and records retrieval. Financial industries need an end-to-end Loan and Information Management System that is secure, fast, transparent, and automates back office activities of business finance.

The existing system used by the WMSU-MPC is considered as obsolete and ineffective in a way that computers are used merely for documentation and not for aiding the day-to-day transactions. The staff and the management of the cooperative experience difficulty in tracing details of loan accounts, slow retrieval of loan records and poor record management. Due to the unsolved problems exist in the system thus, WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System is proposed to satisfy the business’ thirst for solutions.

The WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System in summary, handles member and non-member management, loan application and processing, trading, billings, remittances and collections. It also includes different settings for users, loan type, eligibility settings and more. The system efficiently validates borrower’s eligibility when filling applications, check loan availability and provide different reports such as borrower master list, sales, voucher, payment receipts and more. The system is expected to efficiently manage records, provide transparent collections, reduce workloads of staffs and enable the management to retrieve and process transactions in less time.
 
1. b. Project Site
	The Western Mindanao State University – Multi-Purpose Cooperative was founded in year 1977 when the Human Resource Management Office recognize a problem in the financial incompetence of the employees of the Western Mindanao State University. The WMSU-MPC is located at Normal Road Baliwasan, Zamboanga City inside the WMSU premises, beside the Administration Building, fronting the WMSU Gymnasium.  

	The WMSU-MPC is an organization that offers monetary loans and product loans such as rice and other grocery items, etc. The organization’s members is composed of the employees of the Western Mindanao State University.

	The WMSU-MPC envisions itself to be a service-oriented and development inspired primary cooperative owned and managed by responsible and proactive members, a cooperative community committed to the empowerment of its members towards total human development where there is equality, social justice and sustainable economic development.

	The proposed WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System aims to give solution in the means of fast retrieval of records, proper auditing and record maintenance. The system accurately computes all amount coming in and out of the cooperative and produces accounting reports.

CHAPTER V – PROJECT COSTING

5. a. Project Estimation

	Processing loans and records keeping in the cooperative has been a problem long before the cooperative has been established. Staffs are having a hard time in managing records in their day-to-day transactions especially when tracing loan accounts and their respective guarantor. In addition, auditing records are time-consuming as well as the integrity of manual system is questioned. The WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System is wished to develop to cater the problems imposed by the manual system. 

The new system to develop is expected to reduce load of works assigned to each staff as well as to those who are directly or indirectly associated with the day-to-day transactions in the cooperative. The system accurately computes all digits coming in and out of the cooperative and produces system status through notifications when new transaction is done or an alteration of the system settings has changed. The system can add, update, delete, search and produces reports such as prints based on the priorities assigned to each users and to reduce scope of work of each user.

CHAPTER VI – REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING

6. a. Summary of Requirements Gathering

The PENTABOX Company started gathering data through familiarizing the business flow of the WMSU-Multi-Purpose Cooperative (MPC), individual interview was conducted to the persons who are directly involve to the transaction of the MPC. To be able to evaluate the individual technological experience of each possible users of the system a Computer Literacy survey was conducted (see appendix A for the supporting materials).

For the developers be able to truly understand, sample files, voucher, ledger and all files related to the transaction was asked to the WMSU-MPC management.  The Company is still looking forward for more follow-up interview to the client for more questions that will be encountered in the long run of the system development.

The PENTABOX Ltd. will be using the Waterfall Model in the development of WMSU Multi-Purpose Cooperative Loan and Information Management System. The waterfall model was chosen to ensure that the proposed system will undergo series of security and reliability testing as well as to guarantee that all features and functionalities expected by the client were added to fully delivered system. Series of interviews conducted to harness immediate feedbacks from the users and to specify requirements. The Company manages to have series of follow-up interviews and design prototypes to clarify things and to fill in the missing information specified by the client needed in the system. 

The data that was harnessed was properly used to aid the analysis, understanding and comprehension did by the Company. The System Requirements fruitfully defined, identified, and specified. Important Modules were determined. Additional modules, features and functionalities are expected throughout development process in response to prototypes presented to the client in order to meet the business requirements.


 

6. b. Methodology











The Waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow; hence it is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
	The Team decided to use a the Waterfall method because the concept of this model is simple, easy to manage due to the rigidly of the model – each phase has specific deliverables and review process, phases do not overlap from each other also, one of the best reason why we chose the this kind of model over the other is because Waterfall Model is best to use if and only if the requirements are clear, very well-known and fixed.

6. c. Project Drivers
6. c. 1.  The Purpose of the Project
6. c. 1. a. The User Problem or the Background of the Project Effort
				
The Western Mindanao State University – Multipurpose Cooperative or WMSU – MPC is the target Company that developers wish to develop a system to help in their daily transactions. The cooperative offers monetary loans and product loans such as rice and other grocery items that the services are exclusive only for WMSU employees and retirees.
	
Processing loans and records keeping in the cooperative has been a problem long before the cooperative has been established. Staffs are having a hard time in managing records in their day-to-day transactions especially when tracing loan accounts and their respective guarantor. In addition, auditing records are time-consuming as well as the integrity of manual system is questioned. The WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System is wished to develop to cater the problems imposed by the manual system. 

The new system to develop is expected to reduce load of works assigned to each staff as well as to those who are directly or indirectly associated with the day-to-day transactions in the cooperative. The system accurately computes all digits coming in and out of the cooperative and produces reports to aid auditing and for future reference too. 

6. c. 2. b. Goals of the Product
			
The WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System aims to:
●	Provide the staff of the WMSU-MPC to easily trace borrower in different applications and their co-maker if they have one.
●	Provide an easy way of all computations in the system and provide them a way to print out all of those statements.
●	Automates back office business process.
●	Provide them a way to easily audit all transactions.
●	Provide an easy way of collection entry.

6. d. Project Constraints
6. d. 1. Mandated Constraints
6. d. 1. a. Solution Constraints

The WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System will be able to operate in the Window XP and if the user wishes to upgrade the operating system of his/her computer he/she may do so.  For the system to run smoothly the client’s side should be connected to the server which serves as the main source of the transaction to succeed. More so, the server of the system should be always turn on.

6. d. 1. b. Implementation Environment

SOFTWARE
●	Visual Basic 2013 Ultimate
●	Operating System (Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 8 or later)

HARDWARE
●	Processor (Intel Dual Core, Quad Core, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 or later )
●	Memory (at least 1 GB)

6. d. 1. c. Partner Application

The system will not be successful without the presence of other application such as Metro framework and Microsoft Excel that will be used in importing important data to the system and MYSQL Workbench that serves as the back end database management.

6. e. 1. d. Commercial Off-Shell Product

Programming languages such as SQL and Visual Basic .NET that are known for creating desktop-based systems.

6. d. 1. e. Anticipated Workplace Environment

The expected workplace environment where the user’s computer will be placed should be properly ventilated and should be kept clean. The user’s computer must be set-up a little bit far from each other to avoid messing up with the cables that are used to connect to the server.

6. d. 1. f. Schedule Constraints

Refer to chapter 4 for complete project schedule.

6. d. 2. Naming Conventions and Definitions

Waterfall Model - is a sequential design process, used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards.
Prototype - prototypes display a wide range of features but without fully implementing all of those features
MPC – Multi-Purpose Cooperative
WMSU – Western Mindanao State University

6. d. 3. Relevant Facts and Assumptions
6. d. 3. a. External Factors that have an Effect on the Product, but are not Mandated Requirements Constraints

The WMSU Multi-Purpose Cooperative was established long ago, hence in the long run of the institution it was accompanied with tons of records of the members of the cooperative, if those records of information will be inputted inside the system’s database there is a large possibility in committing human error in the process of saving the individual data of the each members. 


6. d. 3. b. Relevant Facts

1.	Loaning process has become a hustle and runs in a long period of time
2.	Tracking of guarantor has become the main problem
3.	Transparency issue has been unresolved in the manual/traditional process

6. d. 3. c. Assumptions

1.	The Desktop-based system will be delivered to the client on time agreed.
2.	The Functionality of the project will meet the requirements given by the client’s wants.
3.	The Project might not function well if and only if the system itself is malfunctioning.
4.	There would be a possibility that the system will not be fully managed by the client.

6. g. 1. Off-The-Shell Solutions

Readymade system is already available in the market, but the issue is that that is does not meet the client's need and requirements, The WMSU-MPC has its own management and process which should still be the same when a system is implemented.

6. g. 2. New Problems

In the middle of the analysis the project there are some issues that we have encountered for an instance tracking down those people who were member of the said cooperative but are not working for WMSU, how to solve the billing issues for this people? Their remittances, though we are aiming that this will be connected through the payroll of the University for an easy way to determine payment breakdown and etc. This problem came up on designing an   Over the counter method which will allow Non-WMSU-MPC but a member to make a payment and for them to be ease that the money they have remitted is accounted well.
6. g. 3.  Tasks

Refer to Chapter 6.b for more detailed process on the methodology that will used by the system implementation.

6. g. 4.  Risks

In making the system one of the risk that the team is facing is the time frame in developing the system, given only by a short period of time, the team must be able to have an output every day to be able to complete the task. Due to the reason that the project that the team is developing is a Loaning System this requires a narrow understanding with regards with Accounting, in the curriculum that we have, we don’t have any accounting subject that would help us understand the Client’s wants and demand, hence we need to cope up with this and self-tutorial is needed and this leads to more time consuming. Also assuming that the  product is already been delivered to the client, it is also a risk about the technical know-how of each user, we need to adjust on the capability on the user’s side now that there will a lot of changes and some modification on the business transaction.

6. g. 5. Costs

- Refer to CHAPTER V for more details for this requirement

6. g. 6.  Waiting Room

If given the chance that we will be able to modify and improve the system, we have a better idea on how to maximize the use of the system, one of those is the Integration of the Payroll system of WMSU in the system that we are developing, in this way the transparency on the payment that each member is paying is much more at ease, also we would like to propose a Portal on the WMSU MPC , this will be a helpful aid to the members of the cooperative to be able to check the updates that is happening in the WMSU-MPC a line with this one, Notification will be available through Emails and SMS for more easy access.

CHAPTER VIII – TESTING PHASE
8. a. Test Plan

“This document is confidential to PENTABOX Ltd. The information contained herein is not to be distributed or revealed or disseminated within or outside the Ltd. or to any other party other without the prior expressed consent and written permission of PENTABOX Ltd”

8 .a. 1. Introduction

This section describes the purpose and the scope of the test. The objective is to provide a framework that could be used by the Test Engineers to plan and execute the necessary tests for the WMSU-MPC Loan Processing and Management System. 

8. a. 1. 1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the recommended and describe the testing strategies to be employed and overall test approach for the WMSU-MPC Loan Processing and Management System. This includes the list of recommended test requirement, test methodologies, traceability, resource required, and estimated schedule.

8. a. 1. 2 Scope

This test plan describes the unit, subsystem integration, and system level tests that will be performed on components of WMSU-MPC Loan Processing and Management System. It is assumed that prior to testing each subsystem to be tested will have undergone an informal peer review and only code that has successfully passed a peer review will be tested. 
8 .a. 2. Target Test Items

The following have been identified as targets for testing:
●	Modules
User Management
Member Management
Loan Application
Ledger Module
Billings and Remittance Module
Settings
Inventory Management
●	IDE
Visual Studio 2013
●	Database
MySQL v. 5


8 .a. 3 Approach

This section describes the general approach to the testing process. It discusses the reasons for the selected testing strategy. Different strategies are often needed to test different parts of the system.

●	Unit Testing

Also known as component testing, refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level.

●	Integration Testing
		
 Seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together

●	System Testing

System testing, or end-to-end testing, tests a completely integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements.

●	Database Testing

Usually consists of a layered process, including the user interface (UI) layer, the business layer, the data access layer and the database itself.

●	Sanity Testing

Determines whether it is reasonable to proceed with further testing. It consists of minimal attempts to operate the software, designed to determine whether there are any basic problems that will prevent it from working at all.

●	Stress Testing

Is a form of deliberately intense or thorough testing used to determine the stability of a given system or entity. It involves testing beyond normal operational capacity, often to a breaking point, in order to observe the results.

●	Performance Testing

A testing practice performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage.

●	Compatibility Testing

A testing with compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original.

●	Usability Testing

A testing to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand. It is concerned mainly with the use of the application.

●	Alpha Testing

Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers' site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing

●	Beta Testing

Beta testing comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team known as beta testers.

Appendix A – Architectural Design

	

	

	






The WMSU-MPC Loan and Information Management System is developing using a CLIENT-SERVER MODEL. The PENTABOX Ltd. Chooses this type of design for after conducting series of research the client-server is best fits in the business requirements that the system has. Also the Client-server architecture provides better control access with pertains to data and transaction that is running throughout the System. Without the server, the client cannot make any transactions which are good in security aspects. The developers found 7 advantages that the client server has below are the ff.

Data Sharing

Data is retained by usual business processes and manipulated on a server is available for designated users (clients) over an authorized access. The use of Structured Query Language (SQL) supports open access from all client aspects and also transparency in network services depict that similar data is being shared among users 
Integration of Services

Every client is given the opportunity to access corporate information via the desktop interface eliminating the necessity to log into a terminal mode or another processor. Desktop tools like spreadsheet, power point presentations etc. can be used to deal with corporate data with the help of database and application servers resident on the network to produce meaningful information.

Shared Resources amongst Different Platforms

Applications used for client/server model is built regardless of the hardware platform or technical background of the entitled software (Operating System S/W) providing an open computing environment, enforcing users to obtain the services of clients and servers (database, application, communication servers).

Security

Servers have better control access and resources to ensure that only authorized clients can access or manipulate data and server-updates are administered effectively.

Inter-Operation of Data

All development tools used for client/server applications access the back-end database server through SQL, an industry-standard data definition and access language, helpful for consistent management of corporate data. Advanced database products enable user/application to gain a merged view of corporate data dispersed over several platforms. Rather than a single target platform this ensures database integrity with the ability to perform updates on multiple locations enforcing quality recital and recovery.

 Data Processing capability despite the location

We are in an era which undergoes a transformation of machine-centered systems to user-centered systems. Machine-centered systems like mainframe, mini-micro applications had unique access platforms and functionality keys, navigation options, performance and security were all visible. Through client/server users can directly log into a system despite of the location or technology of the processors. 

 Easy maintenance

Since client/server architecture is a distributed model representing dispersed responsibilities among independent computers integrated across a network, it’s an advantage in terms of maintenance. It’s easy to replace, repair, upgrade and relocate a server while clients remain unaffected. This unawareness of change is called as encapsulation.  
Appendix B – Transcribed Interview

Client: Mrs Pillar Encarnado
Chairman of the WMSU MPC 
Date: November, 2016
Interviewer:  Project Manager: Jessa Faye V. Narvasa 
  	     System Analyst: Emanuel G. Oriel

Jessa Faye: Good Afternoon ma’am we are from Department of Computer Science major in Software technology, in line with our course, we are having a software engineering project, in this matter we would like to make your good office as our client in our project.

Ma’am Pilar: I am glad to have you guys, actually I am looking for someone who would actually do a system regarding the Loaning issue in our office, We are having a problem in determining  the guarantor if each loaner. I would like you to do a system that will be useful for our office. Nowadays we are doing the manual system in processing loan of the member, one of the requirement needed for the loan to be granted is that there must be a guarantor which will serve as the person who will pay if the loaner is unable to pay the loan that he/she had applied.
Jessa Faye: So are you saying ma’am that your main concern is just tracking down the guarantor?
Ma’am Pilar: Yes, because as of today we are having a difficulty on tracking down the guarantors account. What I want you to do is that every time a member guaranteed a loan and it will be approve it will be reflected immediately to the accounts of the guarantor, and as long as the loan didn’t mature it will be posted in their individual accounts. For you to truly understand the process that is happening I would introduce you to the General Manager of the WMSU-MPC.

*Introduces to Mr Balais the General Manager *

Emmanuel: What are the steps in applying for loan?

Mr Balais: First the Loaner must have an accomplished application form for loan, after this the application will be checked by the clerk to verify if what kind of loan is available, to be able to proceed the applicant should present his/her 3 previous net take home pay and should be not less than Php. 3,000.00 after this if everything is settled the application will subject to be checked by the credit team, the persons who will verify and grant if the applied loan will be approve or not. If approve the application will return to the MPC office and will be recorded by the clerk, the clerk will release a check of the desired amount and the applicant could have his/her money be changed in the cashier of the WMSU.

Jessa Faye: After a person becomes the member of the MPC has he/she has the right to loan right away?

Mr Balais: New member should pay 6mos contribution before applying for a loan.

Jessa Faye: How much is the monthly contribution of each member? Is it monthly? Quarterly?

Mr Balais: 200 per month is deducted to the members of the MCP in their salary, it is deducted right away as part of the agreed contract between the member and the MCP. But in terms of the deduction of the loan that they have applied the Contractual and visiting lecturer is only subjected to deduction every 3mos. No problem to the Regular employee that is already the member of the MCP there will be a monthly deduction included to their payroll.

Emmanuel: How can the clerk determine how much will the member can be able to loan? Where will be the clerk will have its basis?

Mr Balais: In determining on the amount, everything is based on the share capital of each member, their savings inside the MPC will be the basis, but this also comes with condition, if the loaner is a regular employee of the WMSU he/she can double the amount of his/her loan, if the member is Contractual or Visiting Lecturer the amount of loan that he/she is allowed is only as the same his/her share capital.

Jessa: Is there any means that the monthly contribution will be increase?

Mr Balais:  yes, if agreed by the board the contribution will increase.

Emmanuel: In terms of the type of loan that the MPC is catering, is the loan available for the whole year? Whenever the applicant has the chance to? Is he/she is allowed to?

Mr Balais: Types of loan are seasonal not all loan is being available anytime but we have loans that is ready to loan ( ex. Emergency Loan) but for the seasonal loan, as of today, December the only available loan that could be applied is Christmas Loan only.

Jessa Faye: are they allowed to loan immediately even if the loan they applied is not yet mature?

Ma’am Pilar: They can apply for loan as long as they had already paid their loan for 4 previous month.

Emmanuel: How is the billing done? Remittance?

Clerk 1:  In terms of the billing, after the clerk made the record of the members that are subjected to deduction, it will be passed to the cashier to include to the payroll for the deduction of the salary and will be sending a report to the treasurer. Same as the remittance processes after having the final sum of the money it will be send to the treasurer and will be recorded right away.
